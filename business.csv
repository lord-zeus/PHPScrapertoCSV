business,"Brand Management: Aligning Business, Brand and Behaviour","Learner Career Outcomes","Professor Nader Tavassoli of London Business School contrasts traditional approaches to branding - where brands are a visual identity and a promise to customers - to brands as a customer experience delivered by the entire organisation. The course offers a brand workout for your own brands, as well as guest videos from leading branding professionals. The aim of the course is to change the conception of brands as being an organisation's visual identity (e.g., logo) and image (customers' brand associations) to an experience along ""moments-that-matter"" along the customer journey and, therefore, delivered by people across the entire organisation. Brands are thus not only an external promise to customers, but a means of executing business strategy via internal brand-led behaviour and culture change.

You will learn and practice the following skills:

1.	How to build brands from a broad organisational perspective 
2.	How to lead brand-led culture change with human resource practices at the core (i.e., brand as a lever and not just an outcome) 
3.	How to build brands in multi-brand companies, across cultures and geographies
4.	How to measure brand health in new ways, that is, internally in addition to externally
5.	How to value and capture returns to brands across the organisation - introducing the new concept of employee-based brand equity - and how this is different from the valuation of brands as intangible assets. 

This course allows you to develop the following aspects of yourself:

1.	Head. Gain a deeper understanding of the evolving practice of brand management, one that goes further than practiced in most organisations today
2.	Heart. Be motivated to engage in delivering your own brands – regardless of where you are in your organisation – thereby creating superior value for customers and for your organisation
3.	Hands. Translate learnings into action. As Confucius is supposed to have said: “I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I do and I understand.”",324612,5973

business,"Influencer Marketing Strategy","Greg Jarboe","Influencer marketing is the practice of engaging internal and industry experts with active networks to help achieve measurable business goals.

It offers a wealth of tools for creating visualizations other than charts and the chart options available are constantly increasing and improving, so the newer versions now include waterfall charts, sunburst diagrams and even map charts. But what sets Excel apart is its flexibility, it gives us total creative control over our designs so if needed we could produce our own animated custom chart to tell the right story for our data.Over five weeks we will explore Excel's rich selection of visualization tools using practical case studies as seen through the eyes of Rohan, an environmental analyst. Rohan is required to produce visualizations that will show trends, forecasts, breakdowns and comparisons for a large variety of environmental data sets. As well as utilising the usual chart types he wants to use conditional formats, sparklines, specialised charts and even create his own animated charts and infographics. In some cases, he will also need to prepare the data using pivot tables to drill down and answer very specific questions. We are going to help him achieve all this and present our finished visualizations in attractive reports and dashboards that use tools like slicers and macros for automation and interactivity.

These are the topics we will cover:
Week 1: 	Dynamic visualizations with conditional formatting, custom number formatting, sparklines and macros
Week 2: 	Charting techniques for telling the right story
Week 3: 	Creating specialised and custom charts
Week 4: 	Summarising and filtering data with pivot tables and pivot charts
Week 5: 	Creating interactive dashboards in Excel

This is the second course in our Specialization on Data Analytics and Visualization. The first course: Excel Fundamentals for Data Analysis, covers data preparation and cleaning but also teaches some of the prerequisites for this course like tables and named ranges as well as text, lookup and logical functions. To get the most out of this course we would recommend you do the first course or have experience with these topics. In this course we focus on Data Visualization in Excel, join us for this exciting journey.",26583,551

business,"Negociações de sucesso: estratégias e habilidades essenciais (em Português)","George Siedel","Todos nós negociamos diariamente. No nível pessoal, negociamos com amigos, família, proprietários do imóvel em que moramos, vendedores de carro, funcionários, entre outros. A negociação também é a chave para o sucesso nos negócios. Nenhuma empresa consegue sobreviver sem contratos lucrativos. Dentro de uma empresa, as habilidades de negociação podem levar a avanços na carreira.Este curso fornece uma introdução prática e holística às estratégias e habilidades que podem levar a negociações de sucesso na vida pessoal e nas transações de negócios. O curso cobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação: (1) planejamento, (2) negociação, (3) criação do contrato e (4) execução do contrato. 

Cada estágio analisa as principais questões que você deverá estar preparado para responder em negociações futuras, como:  
•	Quais são os principais elementos em uma análise de negociação, incluindo o preço de reserva fixado, a meta de expansão, alternativas para o negócio em questão e a zona de acordo potencial?
•	Que diretrizes devem ser seguidas ao confrontar questões de ética?
•	Qual é a sua fonte de poder nas negociações e como é possível aumentar o seu poder?
•	Quais ferramentas psicológicas podem ser usadas durante as negociações e quais armadilhas psicológicas devem ser evitadas?
•	Quais são as quatro principais questões de lei contratual que devem estar no checklist de negociação?
•	Quais conceitos e ferramentas podem ser usados ao resolver controvérsias?  

Durante o curso, você assistirá a uma série de pequenos vídeos (que vão de 5 a 20 minutos) sobre cada estágio da negociação.  Os vídeos são interativos e incluem questões para testar o seu entendimento sobre estratégias e habilidades de negociação. O curso também inclui vídeos que dramatizam a arbitragem de uma controvérsia na área de construção e a mediação de uma controvérsia de software de robótica. 

Dependendo do seu planejamento, pode assistir aos vídeos ao longo de algumas semanas ou pode assisti-los todos de uma vez.  Um aluno que assistiu a todos os vídeos de uma vez concluiu que ""É uma série tão boa quanto Breaking Bad"".

Após assistir aos vídeos sobre os quatro principais estágios da negociação, você poderá participar de uma negociação individual que testará as suas qualificações como negociador.  Os vídeos finais do curso verificam a sua negociação e revisam os conceitos e as ferramentas tratados no curso.  Você também receberá feedback sobre o que faz de melhor como negociador e como pode melhorar.

business,"Estilos de Liderazgo: opciones para avanzar en desafíos complejos","Maite Careaga Tagüeña","Liderazgo es una palabra que se usa para muchas cosas diferentes y a veces opuestas. Cuando la gente intenta concertar una definición, hay una tendencia general a recurrir al modelo heroico del liderazgo, de un hombre con características especiales y en un puesto directivo que convence a otros de seguirlo hacia su visión. Este modelo es atractivo, pero limitado y obsoleto para la mayoría de los desafíos que nos importan hoy en día. El “modelo heroico” suele ser muy útil para solucionar problemas que no requieren cambios en las personas involucradas en solucionarlos, pero es menos útil o incluso factible para progresar en la solución de problemas difíciles de definir, en situaciones en que hay mucha incertidumbre, y cuando parte importante del problema son las decisiones hábitos y miedos de la propia gente (tú incluida/o) que necesita trabajar para llegar a la solución.En este curso vamos a preguntarnos ¿qué concepción de liderazgo y qué tipo de habilidades son útiles para el complejo y cambiante mundo en el que vivimos?, ¿cómo se aprenden estas habilidades?, ¿para qué tipo de desafíos es necesario el liderazgo?, ¿qué recursos de poder y formas de autoridad hacen parte del liderazgo y cuáles no?, ¿qué riesgos tiene la práctica del liderazgo?, ¿cómo te proteges?.
 
Vamos a invitarte a que, en el espacio virtual y en tu vida real, adquieras una perspectiva potente, unas “Gafas Efectivas” para mirar el mundo complejo en el que vives, diagnosticar los desafíos que te importan y planear intervenciones para avanzar en ellos. En otras palabras, el curso te acompaña en el proceso de adueñarte de una metodología de diagnóstico e intervención, que llamamos Espiral de Liderazgo Consciente, que te va ayudar a identificar y caracterizar:

1. Tus propósitos
2. Los desafíos y oportunidades que enfrentas para llegar a ellos
3. Los aspectos técnicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades, que tienen que ver con reglas, dinero, conocimiento, expertos y autoridades formales
4. Los aspectos humanos y sistémicos de estos desafíos/oportunidades: que tienen que ver con las personas interesadas y afectadas, sus valores, miedos, las facciones que forman y a veces pelean entre sí, la probabilidad de que sean aliados o detractores
5. Tus recursos formales e informales (y desafíos internos) que afectan el tema que quieres avanzar, y los riesgos del liderazgo que probablemente enfrentarás

Todo ello para que planees intervenciones y experimentos de avance, y reflexiones sobre cómo protegerte (pensando en el sistema, haciendo alianzas, reflexionando en la acción, escuchando a las facciones, gestionando tus emociones, etc)
 
Vamos a invitarte también a observar y profundizar tu habilidad para estar presente y para reflexionar y aprender antes, durante y después de hacer alguna intervención dirigida a mejorar tus resultados personales o de grupo. En otras palabras, vamos a acompañarte a profundizar en tres herramientas que llamamos “Estoy Aquí”;  “Subir al Balcón” y “Parada para respirar” que tienen que ver con meta-observar al mundo, a ti mismo en el mundo y a tu mundo interior y encontrar la respuesta a preguntas como: ¿cómo te sientes cuando estás intensamente presente en una actividad (o en un sistema en el que quieres intervenir para cambiar los resultados)?, ¿cuáles son los mecanismos por los que se dispersa tu atención y las justificaciones que te das a ti mismo para dejar de estar presente?, ¿qué está pasando en el mundo externo?, ¿qué está pasando en tu interior?.
 
Estos objetivos de aprendizaje implican que el curso al que vas a entrar no está diseñado de forma convencional, como clases magistrales en las que un experto te “enseña” conceptos, sino que el rol de los profesores en este curso es el de diseñar oportunidades de aprendizaje para ti, y acompañarte a que reflexiones sobre ellas.
